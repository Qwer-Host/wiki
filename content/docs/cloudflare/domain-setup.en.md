# How to Use Your Domain Instead of an IP Address?

Linking a domain to your server is necessary to make the connection process simpler and faster. Typically, an IP address is used for connection, which can be long and difficult to remember (`123.45.67.89:1234`).

If you link a domain, for example, `play.mhcore.xyz`, it will be easier for players to remember, which can help attract an audience to your server.

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Why do you need this?**
- Easy to remember: `play.mhcore.xyz` instead of `123.45.67.89:25565`
- Professional appearance for your server
- Ability to change hosting without changing the address for players

## Preparation

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Important to remember!**

To begin, you need to:
1. **Purchase a domain** (for example, on Namecheap, GoDaddy, REG.RU, etc.)
2. **Transfer it to Cloudflare** (free, but mandatory for this guide)

If you already have a domain in Cloudflare ‚Äî proceed to the next step!

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Open Cloudflare Dashboard

1. Go to [Cloudflare](https://dash.cloudflare.com/)
2. Log in to your account
3. You will see a list of all your domains

### Step 2: Select Your Domain

From the list of domains, select the one you want to use for your Minecraft server.

### Step 3: Navigate to the "DNS" Tab

In the top menu, find and click on **DNS** ‚Üí **Records**.

---

## Method 1: Setup via A Record (Recommended)

### Step 4: Create a New A Record

Click the **Add record** button and fill in the fields as follows:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Type** | `A` | Record type |
| **Name** | `play` | Any name (subdomain) |
| **IPv4 address** | `123.45.67.89` | Your server's IP address **WITHOUT PORT** |
| **Proxy status** | üî¥ **OFF** | Orange cloud must be **disabled** (gray) |
| **TTL** | `Auto` | Leave unchanged |

{{< callout type="warning" >}}
**Critically important:**
- Proxy Status (orange cloud) **MUST** be disabled!
- In IPv4, specify the IP **WITHOUT PORT** (e.g., `123.45.67.89`, not `123.45.67.89:25565`)
{{< /callout >}}

**Example A Record Configuration:**

![A Record Configuration in Cloudflare](/images/docs/cloudflare/a-record.png)

Save the record by clicking **Save**.

### Step 5: Create a New SRV Record

Now create an SRV record to specify the server port. Click **Add record** and fill in:

| Field | Value | Description |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| **Type** | `SRV` | Record type |
| **Name** | `_minecraft._tcp.play` | Format: `_minecraft._tcp.(your_subdomain)` |
| **Service** | `_minecraft` | Auto-filled |
| **Protocol** | `TCP` | Auto-filled |
| **TTL** | `Auto` | Leave unchanged |
| **Priority** | `5` | Record priority |
| **Weight** | `5` | Record weight |
| **Port** | `25565` | **Your Minecraft server port** |
| **Target** | `play.mhcore.xyz` | Format: `(a-record_name).(your_domain)` |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**SRV Record Fields Explained:**
- **Name:** `_minecraft._tcp.play` means the server will be accessible at `play.mhcore.xyz`
- **Port:** Specify your Minecraft server port (usually `25565` or another)
- **Target:** Should point to the A record you created (e.g., `play.mhcore.xyz`)
{{< /callout >}}

**Example SRV Record Configuration:**

![SRV Record Configuration in Cloudflare](/images/docs/cloudflare/srv-record.png)

Save the record by clicking **Save**.

## Method 2: Setup Without A Record (Alternative)

If your server is hosted on MHCore, you can use the node address directly:

### Step 4 (alternative): Create Only SRV Record

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | `SRV` |
| **Name** | `_minecraft._tcp.play` |
| **Priority** | `5` |
| **Weight** | `5` |
| **Port** | `25565` (your server port) |
| **Target** | `node1.mhcore.xyz` (your node name) |

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**For MHCore Users:**
In Target, specify your node address in the format: `(node_name).mhcore.xyz`

Example: `node1.mhcore.xyz`, `node2.mhcore.xyz`, etc.
{{< /callout >}}

---

## Result

According to the example above, your server will be accessible at:

```
play.mhcore.xyz
```

Players will be able to connect to the server by simply entering this address in Minecraft, without specifying the port!

{{< callout type="success" >}}
**Done!** üéâ

Now players can connect to your server using a beautiful and memorable address!
{{< /callout >}}

## Time for Changes to Apply

{{< callout type="info" >}}
**Please note:**

DNS records may not apply instantly. Typically, changes take effect:
- **Cloudflare:** 1-5 minutes
- **Worldwide:** from 1 hour to 48 hours (due to DNS caching)

If the domain doesn't work immediately ‚Äî wait 10-15 minutes and try again.

## Common Errors and Solutions

### ‚ùå Error: "Unknown host"

**Causes:**
- DNS records haven't propagated yet
- Error in A record configuration
- Proxy Status is enabled (orange cloud)

**Solution:**
1. Check that Proxy Status is **disabled** for the A record
2. Wait 15-30 minutes
3. Clear DNS cache on your computer:
   - **Windows:** `ipconfig /flushdns`
   - **macOS:** `sudo dscacheutil -flushcache`
   - **Linux:** `sudo systemd-resolve --flush-caches`

### ‚ùå Error: Connection via domain works but with wrong port

**Cause:** SRV record is misconfigured or missing

**Solution:**
1. Check for the presence of an SRV record
2. Ensure the port is specified correctly
3. Verify the Name format: `_minecraft._tcp.(subdomain)`

### ‚ùå Cloudflare shows error when creating record

**Cause:** Incorrect data format

**Solution:**
- Ensure Target ends with `.` or contains a fully qualified domain name
- Check that all required fields are filled
- Use only allowed characters (a-z, 0-9, hyphen, period)

## Additional Capabilities

### Multiple Servers on One Domain

You can create multiple subdomains for different servers:

- `play.mhcore.xyz` ‚Äî main server
- `lobby.mhcore.xyz` ‚Äî lobby server
- `creative.mhcore.xyz` ‚Äî creative mode
- `minigames.mhcore.xyz` ‚Äî mini-games

For each, create separate A and SRV records with different names and ports!

### Using CNAME Instead of A Record

If your hosting provides a dedicated address (e.g., `server123.hosting.com`), you can use a CNAME record instead of an A record:

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Type** | `CNAME` |
| **Name** | `play` |
| **Target** | `server123.hosting.com` |
| **Proxy status** | OFF |
